| `TASK_LOCK_TIMEOUT`                    | `60`                           | Expiration (seconds) for the database lock used by the `singleton_task` decorator; after this delay a stale lock is considered abandoned. |

Configuration files for Docker and Nix builds - `env.list`.

If you want to run Django locally like `python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000`, you can use `local_env.list`:

```bash
set -a
source ./local_env.list
set +a
```

## 2. Docker Compose Setup

Docker Compose spins up the web app, Celery workers, PostgreSQL, and Redis in one network.
Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install) before continuing.

### 2.1 Bootstrap Commands

Start the database and Redis services:

```bash
docker compose up -d postgres redis
```

Run initial database migrations:

```bash
docker compose run --rm app python3 manage.py migrate
```

### 2.2 Run Commands

Launch the web app, Celery worker, and beat scheduler in the foreground:

```bash
docker compose up app worker beat
```

Run the same stack in the background:

```bash
docker compose up -d app worker beat
```

Rebuild containers after dependency updates:

```bash
docker compose up --build app worker beat
```

### 2.3 Miscellaneous Commands

Run the Django test suite for the `lead` app:

```bash
docker compose run --rm app python3 manage.py test lead
```

Create an admin user:

```bash
docker compose run --rm app python3 manage.py createsuperuser
```

## 3. Nix Flakes Setup

Nix provides an alternative stack that mirrors the Docker Compose.
Install [Nix](https://nixos.org/download) before continuing.
The flake expects the `nix-command` and `flakes` experimental features to be enabled.
Either set them globally (e.g. add `experimental-features = nix-command flakes` to `~/.config/nix/nix.conf`)
or pass `--extra-experimental-features 'nix-command flakes'` to each command shown below.

### 3.1 Run Commands

All flake outputs live in the `nix/` directory. Prefix the commands with
`./nix` (as in the examples) if you keep the repo layout unchanged.

Enter a development shell with Python, PostgreSQL, Redis, `uv`, and helper tools:

```bash
nix --extra-experimental-features 'nix-command flakes' develop ./nix
```

Launch the entire stack (web, worker, beat, PostgreSQL, Redis) in the foreground:

```bash
nix --extra-experimental-features 'nix-command flakes' run ./nix#stack
```

Or in Docker Compose Like mode:

```bash
nix --extra-experimental-features 'nix-command flakes' run ./nix#stack -- --tui=false
```

Logs are multiplexed by `process-compose`; press `q` to exit while leaving services
stopped cleanly.

Both commands reuse `env.list`. Host names such as `postgres` and `redis` are rewritten to `127.0.0.1` automatically for the Nix setup.

### 3.2 Problem solving

My Nix Flakes build script is far from ideal. If something goes wrong and I'm left with child processes:

```bash
./nix/scripts/kill-services.sh
```

## 5. FAQ

### 5.1 Session data corrupted

If you see something like this in the logs:

```log
app-1     | 2025-09-20 21:00:36 | WARNING | django.security.SuspiciousSession (base) | Session data corrupted
```

Clear your browser's cookies for the domain where the application is running (or on localhost if you haven't changed anything).

To prevent this error, set DJANGO_SECRET_KEY. One way to generate it is:

```bash
echo "DJANGO_SECRET_KEY=\"$(openssl rand -base64 50 | tr -d '\n')\""
```

### 5.2 Why does the daphne port differ in Docker and Nix Flakes?

Nix Flakes uses [process-compose](https://github.com/F1bonacc1/process-compose), which by default occupies port 8080 with its Web service.
I chose 8081 as the default for daphne inside Nix. Not 80, because in WSL2, where I was developing, it requires root access.
